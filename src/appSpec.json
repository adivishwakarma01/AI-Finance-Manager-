    },
    "designSummary": "The design features a sleek, dark-themed aesthetic dominated by deep blues and blacks that evoke a sense of security and sophistication. Bright blue accent colors highlight key interactive elements such as buttons and navigation links, no other colors for buttons, providing clear visual cues for user actions. Typography is modern and geometric, using a bold sans-serif font for headings and a lighter sans-serif for body text, ensuring readability and a contemporary feel. The layout is spacious and modular, with generous padding and margins that create a clean, uncluttered interface. UI components like buttons and icons are minimalistic with rounded corners and consistent styling, reinforcing the modern and professional tone. Imagery includes 3D rendered graphics and product mockups that emphasize innovation and technology. Overall, the design balances a futuristic tech vibe with user-friendly clarity, making it suitable for fintech and crypto platforms.",

      "paletteUsageGuide": "Use the 'background' color as the primary canvas for the website, providing a dark and secure atmosphere. The 'primary' color should be reserved for key interactive elements such as primary buttons, call-to-action highlights, and active navigation links, paired with 'primaryForeground' for text to ensure high contrast. The 'secondary' color serves as a background for content blocks or secondary UI areas, with 'secondaryForeground' used for text and icons in these areas to maintain readability. The 'contentBlockBackground' custom color is ideal for subtle section backgrounds that need to stand out gently against the main background without overwhelming the design. Use 'buttonOutline' for secondary or outlined buttons to maintain brand consistency. The 'iconColor' is suited for icons and minor graphic elements, providing a muted contrast that complements the overall palette. This palette ensures accessibility and visual hierarchy while maintaining a modern, tech-savvy aesthetic.",
      "paletteAccessibilityNotes": "The combination of 'primaryForeground' on 'primary' and 'secondaryForeground' on 'secondary' meets WCAG AA standards for text contrast, ensuring readability for users with visual impairments. The 'background' and 'primaryForeground' pairing also provides sufficient contrast for large text and UI elements. The 'contentBlockBackground' against 'background' offers a gentle contrast suitable for non-textual UI elements and backgrounds. Overall, the palette supports accessibility best practices for both normal and large text sizes."
